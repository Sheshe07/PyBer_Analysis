# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
This project was created to analyze the ride-sharing data by city type. To analyze the ride-sharing data we broke down the project into three different areas and city types. We broke it down to Urban, Suburban and Rural. We also decided to add into the report the total drivers, tota rides, the average ride fares, and the average fare per driver. With this project we are predicting that each cities will be able to understand the cost and how affect different cites and areas.

Based on the chart you can tell the differences between the different areas. The charts shows how the Urban area has more drivers and their total fares are higer. Whereas the Rural area have the lowest between the Urban and the Suburban. Based on the chart we can also conclude that the Urban city uses the ride-sharing service more that any other areas.

# Summary 
Based on a business stand point it safe to say, that the Urban areas uses the ride-sharing service more than any other areas. The city should conduct monthly report to see if anything change through out the year. And, they should also make sure they have enough rides and drivers to accommodate the riders. They should also make sure they know the reason why the other areas don't use it that much. They should make sure it's not because they don't have enough drivers or any other reasons.
